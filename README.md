Rsam2disk is a stand-alone application replacement for the Glowworm Visual Basic modules Rsam2Disk and Ssam2Disk.  The application 1) obtains wave form data from an Earthworm Wave Server, 2) calculates RSAM and SSAM values, and 3) writes them to file.  The RSAM values are calculated for 1 minute and 10 minute intervals while the SSAM value is only calculated for 1 minute intervals.  The application has a GUI to simplify configuration.
